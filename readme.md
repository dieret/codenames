# Codenames

Online version of a [Codenames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codenames_(board_game)),
a popular word gane running on a [flask server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework)).

Czech Games Edition have since released an official (and much more complete) online
version which you can play [here](https://codenames.game/).

A noteable other implementation is [KodeNames](https://github.com/ninjabunny/KodeNames).
