# Todos

## Important

* [ ] When game is won/lost, the control elements in the playground should freeze
* [ ] buttons to restart game with confirmation
* [ ] deploy to server (add wsgi script etc.)

## Nice to have

* [ ] Scroll bar for chat?
* [ ] Have chat display GIFs when someone wins or hits the bomb
* [ ] Make sure the emojis in the chat always work
* [ ] Have an overview over the users in both teams, e.g. two boxes that show the team members
* [ ] Rather than redrawing all of the chat, use one of jQueries "add daughter" functions to add new chat message (except for the beginning)
