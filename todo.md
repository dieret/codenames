## Important

* [ ] Upon game restart, all users should be logged out and redirected to the login page again. 
* [x] When game is won/lost, the control elements in the playground should freeze (really? could be fun to still be able to play around)
* [ ] deploy to server (add wsgi script etc.)
* [ ] Fix margins for char message button and submit button

## Nice to have

* [x] Scroll bar for chat?
* [ ] Have chat display GIFs when someone wins or hits the bomb
* [ ] Make sure the emojis in the chat always work
* [x] Have an overview over the users in both teams, e.g. two boxes that show the team members

## Some day

* [ ] Rather than redrawing all of the chat, use one of jQueries "add daughter" functions to add new chat message (except for the beginning)
